# QuakeScope Documentation

QuakeScope is a full-stack web application designed to visualize and analyze global earthquake data. The applicationâ€™s frontend, built with React.js, provides an interactive user interface featuring dynamic graphs and maps that display earthquake locations and trends. Users can explore different regions with the highest or lowest earthquake activity.

The backend, handles the API requests and data processing from USGS earthquake catalog, while MongoDB will serve as the database to store and manage earthquake data efficiently. QuakeScope aims not only to help users identify prominent earthquake zones but also to analyze patterns over time to provide potential insights into future seismic activity.

This project demonstrates skills in full-stack web development, data visualization, and the integration of real-world geospatial data through APIs.
